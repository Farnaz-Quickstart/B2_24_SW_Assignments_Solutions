## JavaScript: JavaScript Object Oriented Programming Practice
Create a JavaScript constructor function to model a collection of books in a library. Each book object should have properties like title, author, genre, and year, and it should include a method to display details about the book.

### 1- Create a Constructor: Define a Book constructor function that accepts four parameters:
- title (string): The title of the book.
- author (string): The author of the book.
- genre (string): The genre of the book.
- year (number): The publication year of the book.

Each book should also have a method called getSummary that returns a string with details about the book, formatted as:
"Title: [Title], Author: [Author], Genre: [Genre], Year: [Year]".

### 2-	Create Multiple Book Objects
Using the Book constructor, create at least three different book objects. Usesample data for each book.

### 3-	Display Book Summaries
Log each book's summary to the console using the getSummary method.
